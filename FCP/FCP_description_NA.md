# Network Analysis Final Course Project (SMM638)

This repository contains my submission for the final course project of the SMM638 Network Analysis course at Bayes Business School, City, University of London.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to construct and analyze a real-world network dataset using the methods taught in the course. The major tasks include:

- Selecting or building a relevant network dataset (nodes and edges).
- Applying comprehensive network analysis methods such as centrality, community detection, and structural properties.
- Creating clear, effective network visualizations to present your findings.
- Documenting the process in a well-structured and reproducible notebook (Jupyter, RMarkdown, or Quarto).

## Submission Requirements

- Submit a single notebook containing code, visualizations, analysis, and explanations.
- Follow best practices in network analysis, code clarity, and data storytelling.
- Ensure that your project is fully reproducible and easy to follow.
