# Network Analysis Midterm Project (SMM638)

This repository contains my submission for the midterm project of the SMM638 Network Analysis course at Bayes Business School, City, University of London.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to construct, analyze, and visualize a network using appropriate methods and tools. The main tasks include:

- Building a network from a provided or chosen dataset.
- Applying network analysis techniques such as centrality measures, community detection, and structural analysis.
- Creating effective network visualizations to communicate your findings.
- Documenting your approach, code, and interpretations in a clear, reproducible notebook.

## Submission Requirements

- Submit a single, well-organized notebook (Jupyter or RMarkdown) containing your code, analysis, and commentary.
- Follow best practices in network analysis, coding, and reporting.
- Ensure that your work is reproducible and clearly communicates your process and results.
